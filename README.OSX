Building OpenOCD for OSX
------------------------

There are a few prerequisites you will need first:

- Xcode 4 (install from the AppStore)
- Command Line Tools (install from Xcode 4 -> Preferences -> Downloads)
- MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/install.php)
  or
- Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)

libtool, automake, autoconf, pkg-config and libusb can be easily
installed via MacPorts:
  sudo port install libtool automake autoconf pkgconfig libusb [libusb-compat]
or with Homebrew:
  brew install libtool automake libusb [libusb-compat]

You should also specify LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS to allow configure to use
MacPorts' libraries, so run configure like this:
  LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include ./configure [options]

If you're using Homebrew, no custom flags are necessary.

See README for the generic building instructions.

If you use an FTDI-based adapter and have the FTDI kext installed, you
will need to unload it prior to using OpenOCD:
  sudo kextunload FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext
