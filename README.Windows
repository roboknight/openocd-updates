Building OpenOCD for Windows
----------------------------

You can build OpenOCD for Windows natively with either MinGW-w64/MSYS
or Cygwin (plain MinGW might work with --disable-werror but is not
recommended as it doesn't provide enough C99 compatibility).
Alternatively, one can cross-compile it using MinGW-w64 on a *nix
host. See README for the generic instructions.

Native MinGW-w64/MSYS compilation
-----------------------------

As MSYS doesn't come with pkg-config pre-installed, you need to add it
manually. The easiest way to do that is to download pkg-config-lite
from:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pkgconfiglite/

Then simply unzip the archive to the root directory of your MinGW-w64
installation.

USB adapters
------------

You usually need to have WinUSB.sys (or libusbK.sys) driver installed
for a USB-based adapter. Some vendor software (e.g. for ST-LINKv2)
does it on its own. For the other cases the easiest way to assign
WinUSB to a device is to use the Zadig installer:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/libwdi/files/zadig/

For the old drivers that use libusb-0.1 API you might need to link
against libusb-win32 headers and install the corresponding driver with
Zadig.
